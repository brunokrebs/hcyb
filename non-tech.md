Hey <Boss’s name>,

I’ve been evaluating Auth0, an enterprise-grade solution for identity management. Its product drastically reduces development time and provides first-class security. I think we should consider adopting it.

By using Auth0, we can get the following:

**Identity that Just Works**

Auth0 allows our developers to focus on what make us unique. Authentication, Multifactor Authentication, Passwordless and Breached Passwords are just a few features that we get of-the-shelf by choosing Auth0. Using it can help us improve our security and our product at the same time.

**Security and Trust**

Auth0 provides privacy and security that we can trust. They get audited and certified by third parties often. We can rest assured that our data will be secured.

**Increase in Conversion Rates**

Nowadays no one wants to create and remember yet another pair of credentials. With Auth0 we can smooth the sign in process by supporting:

-More than 30 social providers, like: Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc
-Active Directory and LDAP
-SAML federation
-WS-Federation

**B2B, B2C, B2E**

B2B, B2C, B2E

For those reasons, I really think that we should give Auth0 a try. We would save time by using their robust authentication platform and we can focus on creating a great product.

Sincerely,
<Your Name>.
