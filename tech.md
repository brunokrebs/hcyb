Hey <Boss’s name>,

I’ve been evaluating Auth0, an enterprise-grade solution for identity management. Its product drastically reduces development time and provides first-class security. I think we should consider adopting it.

By using Auth0, we can get the following:

**Single Sign On**

Auth0 provides robust *Single Sign On* support. Enterprise connections can be easily configured to support user login with SAML, LDAP, Azure, and more. We can also allow our customers to use their own custom business credentials to sign in.

**Multifactor Authentication**

Auth0 has some great Multifactor Authentication features like Auth0 Guardian. This allows users to sign by tapping a notification rather than opening an app like Google Authenticator. But they also integrate with Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile and SMS out of the box.

**Lock - The Login Box Done Right**

Auth0 Lock provides sign up, sign in, password reset, password strength testing and more in a beautiful interface that we can embed in our apps. The widget’s style can be easily customized to fit our brand.

**More**

We can take even more from Auth0, like:

-Anomaly Detection to detect suspicious login activity
-Auth0 Rules to easily control and customize of the login process
-Passwordless Authentication minimizing sign in and sign up time

For those reasons, I really think that we should give Auth0 a try. We would save time by using their robust authentication platform and we can focus on creating a great product.

Sincerely,
<Your Name>.
